# Inter-Provincial-Education-Comparison (Pakistan)-
Inter Provincial Quality Education Comparison in Pakistan.
The dataset comprises university exam results for the years 2022-23.
Real data consists of around 24,000 semester results (Two years or 04 Semester performance).
Dataset has presence of students from Provinces: Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Federal Capital, FATA, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu & Kashmir.
In this project I will try to highlight provinces having high drop-out ratio from the universities on basis of students' poor performance or low quality education background.
I will also highlight provinces that have remarkable academic performance on the basis of good quality educational background.
I will conclude inter provincial quality education comparison on the basis of student performance.
